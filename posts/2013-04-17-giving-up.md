Yesterday I read an article titled
[News is bad for you â€“ and giving up reading it will make you happier](http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2013/apr/12/news-is-bad-rolf-dobelli)
. To cite the leader,

```
News is bad for your health. It leads to fear and aggression, and hinders your
creativity and ability to think deeply. The solution? Stop consuming it
altogether.
```

Regarding that article, on Hacker News I read
[this comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5551069),

```
With 7 billion people in the world, it's very likely that these things will happen today:
  - someone will get killed in a horrible car accident
  - a child will be killed in a freak accident
  - someone will die from cancer, leaving much grieving behind
  - someone will molest a child
  - someone will lose all their money in a scam
  - someone will get raped
  - someone will be killed by a never-to-be-found hit-and-run drunk driver
  - someone will beat a woman
  - someone will be murdered
  - someone will die in a disaster/fire/earthquake/storm
  - an innocent bystander will be randomly shot to death
  - someone's favorite team will lose
In addition, it seems like something like this (unbelievably) happens all the time:
  - someone will murder many people
  - someone will shake a baby until it's brain dead
  - a soldier will lose vision or use of their limbs in action
  - someone will post a horrible crime on youtube
  - someone will tie a pet to railroad tracks
  - a whole family will die in an accident
I really do feel bad about all of these things, but frankly, I just don't want to be reminded 40 times every day. <closing browser and going back to work>

It was the top voted comment. That irked me. Ironic, huh?

Compounding that feeling was seeing
[Gitmo is Killing Me](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/15/opinion/hunger-striking-at-guantanamo-bay.html)
on HN front page at the very same time.

To be fair to the commenter, the "News is bad" article was posted before the
Gitmo article so their comment may have come before the Gitmo article hit the
front page. And to be fair to the HN community, the Gitmo article was upvoted much more
than the News article. I very much understand the sentiment but I don't want to
"give up" or "close my browser."

#### Passivity

The article states, "News stories are overwhelmingly about things you cannot
influence." True, if I sail toward Cuba with the hope of closing Gitmo I will
probably fail. But if Beyonce can go to Cuba and [stir up a
fracas](http://swampland.time.com/2013/04/11/jay-z-flouts-cuba-trip-amid-republican-outrage/)
isn't there some form of hope?

The article states, "news makes us passive," but that's not the
real issue. The issue is that we're passive to begin with. We start the day with
the mindset of, yes, [learned
helplessness](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learned_helplessness). In that
condition, paraphrasing, we "fail to respond even though there are opportunities
to help ourselves by avoiding unpleasant circumstances (closing the browser) or
_by gaining positive rewards_." We can all agree that when there's a problem
doing something about it feels good.

We can start the day defeated and individually, as a coping mechanism, avoid the
news. Better would be to start the day with possibility, particularly as a
community and society.

The author of that HN comment has the site's third most karma, or reputation.
I feel voting that comment to the top is a rationalization
- a rationalization made OK because the author is such a well
respected member of the community. As hackers we can improve the world in unique
ways. We've personally run
[Tor](https://www.torproject.org/) nodes in support of an Arab Spring. One of us
even built and published an EC2 AMI to make it easier for the rest of us to do
so. And that's just one example.

Don't read the news and let it fester inside. But don't close the browser. You
_can_ find ways to do something about it.
